base-dev
======================

This sets up the machines to test out my chef-base and chef-master cookbooks to
simulate my NAS.

I use 4 disks with ZFS so it sets up seperate disks and tries to setup zfs - note you need to reboot the master VM a few times
for all the kernal modules to kick in properly.
